### The Future of AI-Powered Development 🚀

I’ve been developing software for over **five years** now. I started with **Notepad++**, writing raw HTML, JavaScript, and whatever else I could experiment with. Eventually, I found my way to **VS Code**, a game-changer for productivity—but something still felt **missing**.

As AI tools emerged, I realized that **AI-driven development wasn’t just the future—it was inevitable**. But every existing solution felt… clunky. AI-powered coding should be **seamless, intuitive, and most importantly—effortless**. So, I built **Cake AI**, because **coding with AI should be a piece of cake.** 🎂

This repo contains the **full source code** of Cake AI, our **open-source, AI-integrated code editor** that takes software development to the next level.

🔹 **Autonomous AI Assistance** - AI that doesn't just suggest code but understands the **context** of your project.
🔹 **Lightning-Fast Debugging** - AI-driven insights to help you squash bugs before they ruin your day.
🔹 **Seamless AI Workflows** - No more context switching—AI is embedded **right where you need it**.

> Currently in **open beta** for Discord members, with a waitlist for our official launch. Join us!
